This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API within a component that is conditionally rendered.  The camera preview might not render correctly, or might throw an error, if the component containing the camera is unmounted and then remounted.  This can happen if the component is part of a navigation stack that is frequently changed, or if the parent component re-renders frequently causing the child component with the camera to unmount and remount. This leads to an inconsistent camera preview or crashes.
